        Correct core symptom: cough, fever
2. **Identify the severity**
    - With your Health care experience, give a severity to each symptom
    - Severity should be between 1 and 3 with 1 being mild symptom and 3 being extreme symptom
3. **Prioritize the symptoms**
    - With your Health care experience, give a priority to each symptom
    - Priority should be between 1 and 3 with 1 being high priority and 3 being low priority
3. **Provide the Output in Strict JSON format**: Below is the format
   {{
        "symptoms" : [

                "core_symptom": "fever",
